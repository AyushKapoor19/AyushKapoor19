- 👋 Hi, I’m **@AyushKapoor19**
- 👀 I’m fascinated by a spectrum of technologies, from Programming Languages like C, Java, Python, and SQL to databases such as Oracle, MS Access, MySQL, SQL Server Management Studio, Firebase, and MongoDB.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm deeply engrossed in honing my skills in full-stack development. My focus includes mastering technologies like JavaScript, React, and Node.js. The excitement of building solutions that people can use and enjoy drives my learning journey.
